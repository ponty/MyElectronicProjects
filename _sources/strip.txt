Stripboard design
===================


Stripboard_ design representation in eagle_:

 * holes: copper should be cut or drilled here
 * SMD: through-hole component, legs are drawn on top layer
 * top layer: wires
 * lines on documentation layer: wires
 * bottom layer: original parallel strips of copper, 
   only those are drawn, which are used for connection
 * via: soldering points

Some components have no 3D view in the documentation.
